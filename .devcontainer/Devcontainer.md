# Devcontainers



## Linux

Because of user [restrictions](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/add-nonroot-user), the container cannot be effectively used in Linux 
because the files will be owned by root (but the current user is `vscode`)

***A solution is welcome !***

## Mac

Launch VS Code and `Reopen in container`
